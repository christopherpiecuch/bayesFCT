On 7 December 2020, I realized a minor issue with the code uploaded on 25 November 2020. 
The issue pertains to lines 42-43 of the bayes_main_code.m script, which reads:

coastcode=[902 904 906 908 912 916 930 931 ...
    932 934 936 938 939 940 950 941 960]; % PSMSL ID for coastlines

This line identifies coastlines to be used in the data assimilation following the coastline
numbering scheme from the PSMSL. Number 950 refers to Bermuda. This should not be there, since
no tide gauges from Bermuda were used in the Piecuch (2020). 

This number appears in these lines because I was experimenting with including the record from
ST. GEORGES / ESSO PIER (BERMUDA) to quantify whether it has a meaningful impact on the estimation
of Florida Current transport (following a question from T. Frederikse at NASA JPL at the 2019 AGU
Fall Meeting). Including this tide gauge makes no discernable difference, so I deleted it for the
runs performed in the paper.

So, if the user is trying to reproduce the results from Piecuch (2020), please delete the number
950 from the coastcode definition above.
